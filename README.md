[b]Version 3.8.*[/b]

Ever been unable to invite a long-term associate to join a federation because of a war they had with a member 200 years ago? Can't form a federation in the first place because you took a system someone wanted of a mutual enemy 100 years ago? This mod should address some of these annoyances.

[h1]Claims Decay[/h1]
Adds a new chain of Galactic Community Resolutions - Claims Decay. Once unlocked, every empire in the galactic community will periodically revoke one claim it has on each other member of the community who is not on breach of the resolutions. This happens, on average, every:
[list]
[*]De-escalation Channels: 10 years
[*]Amnesty Conventions: 5 years
[*]Bureau of Reconciliation: 2 years
[/list]
This should prevent claims from hanging around forever and preventing peaceful coexistence. This chain also reduces xenophobe attraction and border friction! However, higher levels come with a price- maintaining a peaceful galaxy will cost you envoys.
