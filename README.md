[b]Version 3.4.*[/b]

Ever been unable to invite a long-term associate to join a federation because of a war they had with a member 200 years ago? Can't form a federation in the first place because you took a system someone wanted of a mutual enemy 100 years ago? This mod should address some of these annoyances.

[*]De-escalation Channels: 10 years
[*]Amnesty Conventions: 5 years
[*]Bureau of Reconciliation: 2 years
